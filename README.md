# 🚀 Python Assessment

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains Python assessment tasks designed to test proficiency in Python programming. It includes multiple scripts, configuration files, and structured project directories.

## ✨ Features
✅ Multiple Python scripts solving different problem statements.  
✅ Configuration files for custom inputs.  
✅ Organized directory structure for better code management.  
✅ Backup functionality to store previous outputs.  

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
### 🔹 Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can check by running:
```sh
python --version
```

### 🔹 Clone the Repository
To get started, clone the repository using Git:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/XXRadeonXFX/python_assessment.git
cd python_assessment
```

### 🔹 Install Dependencies
If any dependencies are required, install them using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
_(Ensure a `requirements.txt` file is present in the repo; otherwise, manually install dependencies.)_

## 🚀 Usage
Run the individual scripts to execute specific assessment tasks.
```sh
python question1.py
python question2.py
python question3.py
python question4.py
```
Modify the configuration file (`sample_config.ini`) to provide custom inputs before running the scripts.

## 📜 Code Description
### 🔹 `question1.py`
📌 This script solves a specific problem using Python. It reads input from a file or user input, processes data, and prints the result.

### 🔹 `question2.py`
📌 Handles data transformation and manipulation. It reads structured data, applies transformations, and outputs formatted results.

### 🔹 `question3.py`
📌 Focused on automation tasks such as file handling, backups, and system operations. It contains logic to manage and process multiple files.

### 🔹 `question4.py`
📌 Implements an algorithm or computational logic to solve a complex problem efficiently. It may involve sorting, searching, or mathematical computations.

### 🔹 `sample_config.ini`
📌 A configuration file used to store settings required by different scripts. Users can modify values to change script behavior dynamically.

### 🔹 `config_output.json`
📌 Stores the processed output data in JSON format for further analysis or reporting.

## ⚡ Configuration
The `sample_config.ini` file allows users to modify input settings for scripts dynamically. The `config_output.json` stores the output results based on execution.
